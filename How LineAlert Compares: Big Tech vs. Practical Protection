🏢 What the Big Boys Do
Large OT cybersecurity firms like Dragos, Nozomi Networks, Claroty, and Fortinet’s OT division offer full-scale platforms that:

🧠 Aggregate tons of real-time data from industrial environments

📡 Deploy sensors across the network to capture deep packet inspection (DPI)

🔍 Use AI/ML to detect anomalies across large, often well-funded infrastructure

🕵️‍♂️ Correlate with threat intelligence feeds and central SOCs

💰 Cost anywhere from $100,000 to $1M+ annually

🔧 Require intensive integration with managed service providers or vendor consultants

🏢 Assume a baseline of:

Skilled in-house staff

Centralized operations

Big-city budgets

These tools are brilliant for Fortune 500s, but are:

Overkill for smaller orgs

Too complex to deploy in basic OT environments

Not built with air-gapped or semi-connected setups in mind

🚨 What LineAlert Does
LineAlert is designed to protect the rest of us — the ones not on Gartner’s radar.

It’s a passive, field-deployable sensor that:

📸 Takes periodic “snapshots” of traffic in OT environments — not full capture

🧠 Auto-learns normal behavior of Modbus/TCP and other industrial devices

⚠️ Alerts when something deviates from known baselines (even without internet)

🔒 Encrypts everything at rest, designed with safety and forensics in mind

🧪 Can be run on a $50 Raspberry Pi or virtual appliance

💡 Requires no configuration, no vendor lock-in, and no massive SOC infrastructure

It works where other solutions don’t:

👷‍♂️ Small municipalities

🏭 Light industrial

🚰 Water treatment

🌞 Solar fields

🧯 Volunteer fire station sensor rooms

🐄 Even the barn with the automated feed control

🌍 Why It Matters
Small towns get hit too.
In fact, they’re easier to hit — because:

There’s no staff watching

No logs

No monitoring

Just blind trust that no one’s messing with the control systems

And as shown in real-world cases like Oldsmar, Florida, even a basic change in chemical feed can harm or kill.

💡 The LineAlert Philosophy
“Big Tech built solutions for those who could already afford protection. We built one for those who couldn’t.”

LineAlert doesn't try to replace Dragos or Nozomi.
It fills in the massive blind spot they leave behind.
