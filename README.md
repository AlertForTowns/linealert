# LineAlert

**LineAlert** is a cutting-edge cybersecurity platform designed to monitor and protect operational technology (OT) systems, with a focus on small municipalities. By providing real-time alerts and adaptive learning, it ensures the safety of critical infrastructure and protects lives.

---

## Prerequisites
To run **LineAlert**, you need the following:

- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries (can be installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

Make sure to configure your OT systems accordingly for integration.

## Setup & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anthonyedgar30000/linealert.git
    cd linealert
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Modify the configuration:
   - Open the sample configuration file (`config_sample.yaml`) and adjust the settings according to your OT network.
   - Ensure that you specify the correct log file paths and any system-specific variables.

4. Run LineAlert:
    ```bash
    python linealert.py
    ```

5. Confirm it's working:
   - You should see real-time alerts in the form of notifications or logs indicating that the system is monitoring your OT systems.
   - Example output:
     ```
     [ALERT] [2025-04-07 15:30] Potential breach detected in OT system.
     ```

## Troubleshooting

### 1. **Permission Denied Errors**
   - Make sure your configuration files have the correct permissions:
     ```bash
     chmod 755 config/
     chmod 644 config/config_sample.yaml
     ```

### 2. **Alerts Not Triggering**
   - Double-check your alert configuration and ensure that the system is properly set up to monitor the correct log files.
   - If your logs are not updating, verify that the log file paths are correct in your configuration.
